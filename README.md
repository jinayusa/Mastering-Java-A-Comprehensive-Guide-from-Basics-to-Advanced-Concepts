Project Overview
This repository is designed to provide a comprehensive guide to mastering Java. It includes code examples that cover:

Basic Java syntax
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Exception handling
Generics
Streams API
Multithreading
Design patterns
JavaFX for GUI
RxJava for reactive programming
Spring Boot for building REST APIs
Each example is carefully designed to demonstrate practical uses and key concepts of Java. These examples are categorized based on their difficulty level, from beginner to advanced.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Java JDK 11 or higher (Java 8 for older examples).
Maven or Gradle for dependency management.
IDE: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any text editor of your choice.
Steps to Set Up
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Mastering-Java.git
cd Mastering-Java
For Maven users:

If you're using Maven, make sure to add the dependencies listed below in the pom.xml file.

xml
Copy
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.reactivex.rxjava3</groupId>
    <artifactId>rxjava</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0</version>
</dependency>
For Gradle users:

If you're using Gradle, add the dependencies in the build.gradle file:

gradle
Copy
implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
implementation 'io.reactivex.rxjava3:rxjava:3.0.0'
JavaFX (if using JavaFX examples):

If you plan to run the JavaFX examples, you need to set up JavaFX SDK on your machine. Download the JavaFX SDK here.

Add the following VM options to run JavaFX applications:

bash
Copy
--module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
Replace /path/to/javafx-sdk/lib with the actual path to the lib directory in your JavaFX SDK.

Once the setup is done, you can start running the examples!
